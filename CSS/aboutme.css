                <h1 class="aboutme-titulo">About me</h1>
                <p class="aboutme-text">I completed my secondary education oriented to Social Sciences; There I developed my communication skills, teamwork, text writing and I carried out different citizen intervention projects. When I finished, I moved to Cordoba Capital to live alone and study Engineering. In my third year of college I realized that I also want to be a Web Developer and that's when I started training for this. I'm still learning and trying to find my way in the world of technology but I have a marked interest in Front-End development.</p>
